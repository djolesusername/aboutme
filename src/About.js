          I am Djordje, a fan of programming and web development. Being self
          thought programmer I was lucky enough to have an awesome mentor - a
          philosopher-friend with 10+ years of programming experience. I am
          constantly working on myself and current environment really helps: I
          am working as technical support in tech-savy and young team. Iâ€™m
          interested in human sciences - education, psychology and ethics but I
          also love to play with numbers and data.
